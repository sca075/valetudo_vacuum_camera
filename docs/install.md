### How to Install and Configure the Camera:
Using [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/) (current HACS version  1.34.0) add custom repositories by clicking on the three dots on the top right of the HACS page and select **Integrations**:

please copy the repository link below in ***Custom repositories*** section.

```
https://github.com/sca075/mqtt_vacuum_camera.git
```

Select **Integration** as _Category_ and click the **Add** button.

Once the repository is added, please click on the repository and the home page will be display. From there you need to
**Download** the integration, [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/) will setup the integration for you. (Note: You can selct here if you want to be notify for beta releases that some time are containg instant fixes).

You will need to restart Home Assistant at this point to have the integration available. Once Home Assistant will reload, please go in (plase press CTRL clicking the link this would open the link in a different tab of your browser) [**Settings** -> **Devices & Services**](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start/?domain=valetudo_vacuum_camera) then please confirm to add the integration.
The setup will start, you just select here the vacuum and the camera will be configured.

The configuration of the colours you would prefer for each element in the maps can be done via Options. The camera will is connect automatically to the HA MQTT (whatever setup you use), for each vacuum you configured a new entity will be added to the configuration.

The camera entity created will have the same friendly name of your vacuum + "camera" at the end. For example vacuum.robot1 = camera.robot1_camera.

### Manual Setup.
If you want to install this camera manually without HACS:
Check the last release available and REPLACE_IT (at current v1.5.9)
To install this integration manually you have to download valetudo_vacuum_camera.zip and extract its contents to config/custom_components/valetudo_vacuum_camera directory:

```
mkdir -p custom_components/valetudo_vacuum_camera
cd custom_components/valetudo_vacuum_camera
wget https://github.com/sca075/valetudo_vacuum_camera/archive/refs/tags/v.1.5.9.zip
unzip valetudo_vacuum_camera_v1.5.9.zip
rm valetudo_vacuum_camera_v1.5.9.zip
```

Once the files are in the right place, you will need to restart Home Assistant to have the integration available. Once Home Assistant will reload, please go in (plase press CTRL clicking the link this would open the link in a different tab of your browser) [**Settings** -> **Devices & Services **](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start/?domain=valetudo_vacuum_camera) then please confirm to add the integration.

### Card Configuration:

Configuration of the [card](https://github.com/PiotrMachowski/lovelace-xiaomi-vacuum-map-card) (thanks to [@PiotrMachowski](https://github.com/PiotrMachowski)) once the camera is installed requires:

*calibration source will be set to camera **not to identity** as the camera is providing the calibration points to the card.*
```
calibration_source: 
  camera: true 
```

**Warning: You need to use the internal_variables**: As Valetudo is using MQTT is necessary to set in the card the
topic.
*Your topic can be obtained also from the camera attributes vacuum_topic.*

![Screenshot 2023-10-24 at 18 25 59](https://github.com/sca075/valetudo_vacuum_camera/assets/82227818/080b7bcb-19f1-4415-870f-2285329e7ce9)

***Note: "YOUR_TOPIC_HERE" must be replaced with what you can find it in the camera attributes. The vaulue is Case
Sensitve.***
```
internal_variables: 
  topic: valetudo/YOUR_TOPIC_HERE  
```

We did agree and work with the author of the card, we guess soon a [new version of the card](https://github.com/PiotrMachowski/lovelace-xiaomi-vacuum-map-card/actions/runs/7005593157) will be released.
Those settings for the internal_variables will be automatically setup in the card as soon the vacuum and camera will be setup in the card.

### Camera Configuration:

**This integration is not configuring the Vacuums**, you need to configure the vacuum in the vacuum UI. Also, it is not
possible to change the Images options form the vacuum UI.
This project runs in parallel, is not a fork of the original Valetudo project you selected.

It is possible to **configure the camera via the Home Assistant UI**, as we aim to extract the Vacuums maps in the Home
Assistant UI.
The camera entity created will have the same friendly name of YOUR_VACUUM_camera at the end.

To configure the Camera Options use Home Assistant "Settings" -> "Devices & Services" -> "Valetudo Vacuum Camera" in
the "Integration" tab.

The setup of the options of the camera include:
https://github.com/sca075/valetudo_vacuum_camera/blob/main/docs/images_options.md
- [**Image Options**](https://github.com/sca075/valetudo_vacuum_camera/blob/main/docs/images_options.md)
- [**Configure Status Text**](https://github.com/sca075/valetudo_vacuum_camera/blob/main/docs/status_text.md)
- [**Configure the Colours**](https://github.com/sca075/valetudo_vacuum_camera/blob/main/docs/colours.md)
- [**Export the logs of this integration**](https://github.com/sca075/valetudo_vacuum_camera/blob/main/docs/snapshots.md) (we filter the logs of the camera only as we don't want
  to know what you run on your instance of Home Assistant)
