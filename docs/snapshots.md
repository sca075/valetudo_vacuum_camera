### Snapshots ###

***Category:*** Camera Configuration - Image Options - Export PNG Snapshot.

***Default:***  Enabled

**Waring: Please keep in mind that the snapshot image will be not automatically deleted from your WWW folder while the
PNG export is enable**

The snapshots images are automatically stored in www (local) folder of HA, by default this function is enable.
The Camera take a snapshot of the maps when the vacuum is "idle", "docked" or in "error" state if this option is enabled.
It is possible to disable the PNG export from the camera options thanks [@gunjambi](https://github.com/gunjambi)
as soon this option is OFF the PNG will be deleted from the WWW folder.

When the vacuum battery get empty because of an error during a cleaning cycle, or in different conditions as per the below example.
If the option is enable will be possible to create an automation to send the screenshot to your mobile. 
When using the below example HA editor please edit the automation in yaml because the snapshot attribute (used in this example)
provides boolean values True or False.
HA editor will translate to "True" (string) from the UI editor, home assistant will not notify you in this case.

**Warning: Please keep in mind that the snapshot image will be not automatically deleted from your WWW folder while the
PNG export is enabl)**
